## 10. Problem Statement

Job interviews are high-stakes situations where candidates often struggle due to lack of practice, feedback, and preparation. Traditional interview preparation methods like practicing with friends or hiring expensive coaches have significant limitations in availability, consistency, and specialized knowledge across different industries. Key challenges include:

- **Limited Practice Opportunities**: Friends and family may not have industry expertise or interviewer perspective
- **Lack of Objective Feedback**: Self-assessment is difficult, and personal connections may be reluctant to provide critical feedback
- **No Standardized Evaluation**: Without clear metrics, it's hard to track improvement
- **Inaccessible Professional Coaching**: Interview coaching is expensive and not widely available
- **Anxiety and Confidence Issues**: Without sufficient practice, many candidates experience high stress during actual interviews

There's a clear need for an accessible, personalized solution that provides realistic interview practice with immediate, objective feedback to help job seekers improve their performance and confidence before actual interviews.

3. Users participate in the interview using their webcam and microphone
4. After each answer, the AI evaluates responses and provides specific feedback
5. Upon completion, users receive detailed feedback and ratings with improvement suggestions
6. Users can review past interviews and track progress over time

### Technical Implementation
- **Front-end**: Next.js for a responsive, accessible user interface
- **AI Integration**: Gemini 1.5 Flash model for question generation and answer evaluation
