QFD Matrix Overview
The QFD matrix I've created includes:

Voice of the Customer: Key user requirements with importance ratings
Technical Requirements: The main features implementing these requirements
Relationship Matrix: How technical features satisfy user requirements
Technical Correlations: How technical features interact with each other
Technical Importance Rating: Prioritization of features based on requirements
Current Implementation Assessment: Evaluation of your current codebase
Competitive Assessment: How your project compares to potential competitors
Key Insights and Recommendations: Strategic improvement suggestions
Implementation Roadmap: Prioritized action plan
Key Insights from the QFD
Highest Priority Technical Features
Answer Evaluation Algorithm (16.2% importance)

This is the core of your application's value proposition
Currently implemented using Gemini AI with custom prompts
Feedback Generation System (15.4% importance)

Directly impacts user satisfaction and learning outcomes
Currently handled by structured AI prompts
AI Question Generation (13.8% importance)

Ensures relevance to specific job roles and skills
Well implemented but could expand to more industries
Rating Calculation (13.2% importance)

Currently has a hardcoded divisor (25) that assumes 5 questions
Recommendation to make this dynamic based on actual question count
Areas for Improvement
Based on the analysis of your codebase, the most important improvement would be the rating calculation system, which currently uses a fixed divisor of 25 regardless of the actual number of questions.

Next Steps
If you'd like to implement any of the recommendations from the QFD, I can help you with:

Making the rating calculation dynamic based on the number of questions
Improving the AI prompts for better answer evaluation and feedback
Enhancing any other specific area you'd like to focus on
